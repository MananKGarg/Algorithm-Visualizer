# Algorithm-Visualizer
SOC_2021

## Progress Report

* Week 1 to Week 8 were spent on studying Data Structures and Algorithms, particularly Pathfinding Agorithms in detail. Basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript were also covered during this time.
* Week 9 was spent learning React Framework and Bootstrap. A practice functional website that included counters was created. The code can be found here
* Week 10 was spent on implementing Dijkstra's Pathfinding Algorithm, building a grid and animating the flow of the algorizthm. The code by far can be found here.
* Remaining - Implementation of BFS, A*, DFS
